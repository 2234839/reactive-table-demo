# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: npm install
        run: npm install

      # 在 github actions 的编译下会在 vscode-json-languageservice 下安装他相关的依赖，
      # 但我本地开发的时候没有出现这个情况，config-editor 这个组件为了本地化需要重写 vscode-nls
      # 如果让 vscode-json-languageservice 安装了他的依赖则会让我的重写失效，所以这里删去
